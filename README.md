## Description
This dataset provides the results of trajectory evaluation conducted under **normal weight patient conditions**, isolating external weight effects to emphasize **kinematic and control performance**.  
The analysis highlights the superior performance of **Minimum Jerk** and **Minimum Snap** profiles compared to Trapezoidal and standard Polynomial trajectories.  

---

## Usage
The dataset may be used to:
1. Reproduce trajectory profile comparisons across four planning strategies.  
2. Analyze smoothness, accuracy, and efficiency under standardized conditions.  
3. Support further research in **surgical robotics trajectory optimization**.
